    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My Name is Emily and I am a Computer Science Major at <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">The University of Rhode Island.</a> and I am looking forward to all the new things I will learn this year.</p>
    <p>In high school I was a member of a dance team called the falconettes. I had also previously danced for 14 years and did competitive dance for 6 years. In high school I also was part of the Career and Tech Robotics program where I learned how to code in c++. </p>
